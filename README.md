Facebook-Message-Analysis
=========================

Python scripts to parse through Facebook messages and show which words are used most often

Facebook (at time of writing) can give a user a log of all their messages. This is the "messages.html" file. 
(All files shown here are samples, not my actual messages.)

Run "message.py", which will output "out.html". This file contains the content of messages, as "message.py" strips away timestamps, names, and html formatting from "messages.html".

Run "out.py", which will output "count.html". This file lists the frequencies at which each word is used.
